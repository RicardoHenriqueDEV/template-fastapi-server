### ![FastAPI Logo](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-teal.png)

This API was created as a simple demonstration of how to implement an API server using FastAPI.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Fast: High performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
- ðŸ“š Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- ðŸ”§ Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200%. *FastAPI is a web framework to create APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.*
